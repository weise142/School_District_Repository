# School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze district-wide standardized test results. Data is presented to show trends in school performance based on student grade, type of school, school budget, and school size. This analysis will be used to make decisions about future school budget and priorities of resources. 

The analysis of this project is completed using python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook, and the Pandas Library. These tools were used to manipulate data into tables, creating snapshots of school districts's key metrics and illustrate trends among schools such as top 5 performing and bottom 5 performing schools based on average reading and math scores.
